Status is a secure messaging app, crypto wallet, and Web3 browser built with state of the art technology. Status uses an open-source, peer-to-peer protocol, and end-to-end encryption to protect your messages from third parties. No phone number, email address, or bank account required when creating your free Status Account. With its [Private Messenger](https://status.im/private-messenger/), Status removes centralized choke points from your messages for greater privacy and security. Levering a peer-to-peer network instead of centralized servers for the routing of messages, your communication is yours and yours alone. Using a decentralized `Web3` browser, explore the growing ecosystem of DApps including marketplaces, exchanges, games and social networks. Latest security standards ensure a private browsing experience. Status is both free (libre) open source software reviewable by anyone as well as free (no cost) to install.

## Quick Start

1. [Download](https://status.im/get/) the app for Android, iOS, or as a desktop application
2. Open the app and click `Get Started`. You can either generate a new key or use an existing one. [Learn more](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#private-key) about this.
3. If you generate a new private key, you'll first choose a public chat name that is a human friendly set of three random words corresponding to a new Ethereum address.
4. The password you set is used for signing transactions. It's not related to anything stored on the blockchain, it's protection just in case, for example, someone else had your phone and tried to do something in the app like send a transaction from your account.
5. Now that you're in, it is recommended the first thing you do is *back up your seed phrase*. Click `Profile` -> `Privacy and Security` -> `Back up seed phrase` and write down the 12 words you see then follow the prompts. If you lose these words, and you then lost/wiped your phone or uninstalled Status, there is no way to recover your account.
6. Want to chat? Start a new chat and enter the ENS name `fugue.stateofus.eth` and ask to join one of our private groups.

## Status Account Setup

* Remember your password! Write it down and keep it in a safe place. Use a password manager like LastPass or 1Password. We don’t store your password anywhere. You and only you have access to your password so make sure you remember it. Don’t reuse passwords - Use unique, secure passwords that are 8+ characters and use a variety of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. You will need this password to open the app and confirm transactions

* Back up your 12 word recovery phrase. You will only have one chance to write this down, so make sure you write it down on a piece of paper offline when you create your account. Don’t take a screenshot or type it somewhere online where it can be compromised. Write it down and store it offline in a secure place. Remember, this phrase is used to recover your entire account. Anyone who gains access to this can access your account and the funds held within it. Status does not store this phrase anywhere, so we can’t help you recover your account if you lose your recovery phrase. For all intents and purposes, this phrase is your Status wallet and identity.

## Status Wallet

* Remember your Three Word Signing Phrase - remember this phrase and make sure you see it every time you send a transaction. You will be prompted to confirm these three words every time you sign a transaction. If you see a different three words, or no words at all, do NOT confirm the transaction. This three word signing phrase is to protect you from any phishing scam and sending funds to a malicious account.

* Do not store large quantities of crypto on your Status Wallet. You should never store massive quantities of funds on your wallet. Think of it like a physical wallet. Only store what you need to interact. Keep large amounts of cryptocurrency offline in cold storage with a hardwallet such as a Ledger or Trezor.
